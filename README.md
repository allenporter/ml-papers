# ml-papers

This repo is for attempting to read research papers and reproduce the results in order to better understand and learn various ML techniques.

Currently, working through some of the papers linked from https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers

## Development

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The above won't account for any hadrware accellerated versions of ML libraries (e.g. cuda, metal, etc)
