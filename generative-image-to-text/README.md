[GIT: A Generative Image-to-text Transformer for Vision and Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14100.pdf)

This improves on existing image to text models by not needing many smaller
components, just using a single image encoder and text decoder.

## Model

This is following the tutorial [Image captioning](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tasks/image_captioning)
at huggingface which loads the pre-trained model and performs fine-tuning.
